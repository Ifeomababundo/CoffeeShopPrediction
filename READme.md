## Requirements

1. **Python Version**: Python 3.9+
2. **Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## How to Run

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Ensure all required libraries are installed by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Train the Models
Run the training script to process the data and train the models:
```bash
python final_project.py
```
This will generate the trained models and scaler, which are saved in the `models/` directory.

### Step 3: Launch the Streamlit App
Run the Streamlit app to use the trained models for predictions:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Using the Streamlit App

1. After running `streamlit run app.py`, a URL will be provided in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).
2. Open the URL in your browser.
3. Input the required features (e.g., transaction quantity, unit price, hour of the day, etc.).
4. Select the model(s) you want to use for predictions.
5. View the predicted revenue and model performance scores.
